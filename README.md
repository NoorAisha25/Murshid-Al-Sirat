# Problem Statement
Youth in rural areas often lack access to structured career guidance due to limited exposure, absence of professional counselors, and poor awareness of skill development opportunities. Many students are unaware of job-oriented courses, government schemes, or online training platforms that could help them build a career aligned with their interests.

It supports multilingual interaction and is grounded in ethical principles, helping youth explore career paths aligned with their interests and values.
